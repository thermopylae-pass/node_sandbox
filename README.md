# node_sandbox
A small working example of node.js in action.  This example demonstrates node initiating a server side listener and how it responds to
a client side requests to add and/or upload a file.

steps to run:
1. open a terminal and navigate to the base folder and type: node index.js - this will initiate the server which is set to listen on port 8888
2. open your browser of choice and type: http://localhost:8888/
3. the rendered page will show two buttons: Choose File and Upload file
